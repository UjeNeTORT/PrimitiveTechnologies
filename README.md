# Processor Assembler and Disassembler
## How to install and run 
1. ``` git clone https://github.com/UjeNeTORT/Processor ```
2. You now have to create txt file with your program and run it with processor, to see list of available commands open "user_commands.txt" (it may not be up to date because i have to edit it manually each time i add command, and i sometimes forget to do it) 
3. In your freshly cloned repository there is a MakeFile, open it and type in ```asm_flags``` path to your txt file
4. ``` make ```
